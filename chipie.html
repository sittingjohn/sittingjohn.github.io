  <p>In 1967, Jean-Michel Signoles, at 17 years of age, created the brand Chipie. He mixed strong influences of
    American vintage and French fashion. The very simple design of Chipie Shoes has been resilient throughout decades
    with its effortless classic styling.

  <p>To this day Chipie Shoes are still produced in small factories deep in the Pyrenean mountains of Spain on machines
    that date back to the 50â€™s. This very traditional and old fashioned way of making shoes is the reason for the
    unique and vintage feel to the products.</p>
