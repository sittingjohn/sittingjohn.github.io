  <p>FitFlopTM was launched in 2007 by Marcia Kilgore. Working with Dr Dave Cook and Darren James – biomechanists at
    London South Bank University – Kilgore began research on a pressure-diffusing, shock-absorbing midsole, and then
    built a sandal brand around it.
  </p>

  <p>Now, ten years later. Over 22 million pairs of Fitflop shoes have been sold to die-hard fans worldwide.</p>
  <p>Today FitFlop makes shoes, sneakers, clogs, boots, ballet pumps and slippers alongside its classic sandals. Marcia
    has pulled off the near-impossible feat of turning comfy and ergonomic footwear into a hot fashion statement via
    design collaborations with Anna Sui, Kirna Zabete and Wola nani.</p>
