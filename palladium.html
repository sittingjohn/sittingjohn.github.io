  <p>After World War II, with aircraft manufacturing screeching to a halt, the demand for tires decreased dramatically.
    Palladium decided to open a plant in Pont De Cheruy, France, to start producing footwear that was as hard wearing
    as their tires. In 1947 the legendary Pampa boot was born, and the functionality, comfort and durability were so
    outstanding that the French Foreign Legion adopted it for their use. The Foreign Legion put the boot to the test in
    the harsh desert conditions of North Africa, and throughout the rugged terrain of the Atlas Mountains.</p>

  <p>Today, the original design, classic lines and time tested utility are as relevant as they have ever been.
    Combining over 60 years of authenticity with modern manufacturing, premium materials and cutting edge styling,
    Palladium boots are ready to help you explore your street, your city, or the world.</p>
